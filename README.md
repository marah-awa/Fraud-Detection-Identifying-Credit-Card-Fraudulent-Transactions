# 💳 Fraud Detection – Identifying Credit Card Fraudulent Transactions

This project uses machine learning to identify fraudulent credit card transactions based on a dataset of real-world transactions.

## 📌 Overview

Credit card fraud is a major financial threat. In this notebook, we explore data preprocessing, visualization, and training of machine learning models to distinguish between **fraudulent** and **non-fraudulent** transactions.

- [`Fraud Detection.ipynb`](https://colab.research.google.com/github/marah-awa/Fraud-Detection-Identifying-Credit-Card-Fraudulent-Transactions/blob/main/Fraud%20Detection.ipynb) – Open in **Google Colab**

## 🔍 Dataset

- The dataset used is anonymized and highly imbalanced (very few fraud cases).
- Features have been transformed using PCA to maintain privacy.

## ⚙️ Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

- Confusion Matrix
- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- ROC-AUC Curve

## 🛠 Tools
